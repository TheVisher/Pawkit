## CURRENT SPRINT

**Focus**: Pre-merge UI polish and multi-session detection fixes

### Active Work

- [✓] Fix cursor jumping in note editor (30 min) - [implemented: ✓] [tested: ✓] [complete: ✓]
  Remove `card.content` from useEffect dependency in card-detail-modal.tsx:391-394
  Why: Users report cursor jumping when typing in notes, breaks writing flow
  Completed: October 29, 2025 - Removed card.content from dependency array to prevent cursor reset on auto-save

- [✓] Remove heartbeat system (1 hour) - [implemented: ✓] [tested: ✓] [complete: ✓]
  Delete /app/api/sessions/heartbeat/route.ts and client-side heartbeat calls
  Regenerate Prisma client without DeviceSession model
  Why: Causing 500 errors, doesn't prevent race conditions, adds overhead
  Completed: October 29, 2025 - Multi-session detection now uses localStorage only

- [✓] Add database duplicate prevention (2 hours) - [implemented: ✓] [tested: ✓] [complete: ✓]
  Add `@@unique([userId, url])` constraint to Card model in schema.prisma
  Update createCard to handle duplicate constraint errors gracefully (return existing card)
  Run migration and test duplicate URL saves
  Why: Prevents race condition duplicates at database level (proper solution)
  Completed: October 29, 2025 - Database constraint added, server catches P2002 errors and returns existing card

- [ ] Test duplicate prevention across devices (15 min) - [implemented: ] [tested: ] [complete: ]
  Save same URL from two different browsers simultaneously
  Verify only one card created and both clients show same card
  Why: Validate the core issue from multi-session work is resolved

### Discoverability Improvements (User Feedback Priority)

**Context**: User testing revealed features are built well but not discoverable. Right-click menus, CMD+select, hover+button all work perfectly - users just don't know they exist. Focus on guiding new users through core workflow: Create Pawkit → Add cards → Organize.

- [ ] Interactive onboarding checklist (3 hours) - **PRIORITY** - [impl: ] [test: ] [done: ]
  Why: Primary solution for discoverability - guides new users through core features
  Impact: Users discover existing features naturally through guided workflow
  User feedback: "Adding to collections unclear" + "Renaming not intuitive" - guide instead of rebuild
  Implementation:
    - Shows on first login, dismissible with progress tracking
    - Step 1: 'Create your first Pawkit' (highlights sidebar + button, shows creation flow)
    - Step 2: 'Add cards to your Pawkit' (demonstrates right-click, drag-drop, and hover+button options)
    - Step 3: 'Organize with nested Pawkits' (shows drag Pawkit onto Pawkit for hierarchy)
    - Tracks completion in localStorage (pawkit-onboarding-checklist-progress)
    - Can be reopened from settings/help menu ('Show onboarding checklist')
    - Contextual - each step appears in relevant view (Step 1 in Library, Step 2 when hovering card, etc.)
    - Use glass modal with purple glow for checkmarks
  Command: `claude-code "Create interactive onboarding checklist: 1) Create onboarding-checklist component with 3 steps, 2) Step 1: Create first Pawkit (highlight sidebar + button), 3) Step 2: Add cards (show right-click, drag, hover+button demos), 4) Step 3: Nest Pawkits (demo drag onto pawkit), 5) Track progress in localStorage 'pawkit-onboarding-checklist-progress', 6) Add 'Show onboarding' option in settings, 7) Make contextual - steps appear in relevant views, 8) Use glass modal design with purple glow checkmarks"`

- [ ] Inline Pawkit rename (30 min) - [impl: ] [test: ] [done: ]
  Why: Click-to-edit is more intuitive than menu-based rename
  Impact: Makes renaming obvious through direct interaction
  User feedback: "Renaming collections not intuitive" - make affordance clearer
  Implementation:
    - Click Pawkit name in sidebar to edit directly (like Finder/Explorer)
    - ESC to cancel, Enter to save
    - Show subtle edit icon on hover to signal editability
    - Location: Pawkits sidebar (left sidebar)
  Command: `claude-code "Add inline rename to Pawkits sidebar: 1) Make Pawkit name editable on click, 2) Show input field with current name, 3) ESC to cancel, Enter to save, 4) Auto-focus input on click, 5) Show subtle edit icon (pencil) on hover, 6) Validate name not empty before saving"`

- [ ] Enhanced visual affordances (45 min) - [impl: ] [test: ] [done: ]
  Why: Subtle visual cues help users discover interactive elements
  Impact: Users notice drag zones, selection states, and interactive areas
  User feedback: "Visual aspect of app is strong" - use visuals to guide interaction
  Implementation:
    - Selected cards: stronger visual state with purple border glow (currently too subtle)
    - Drag state: show drop zones on Pawkits with purple highlight when card is dragged
    - Hover + button: subtle pulse animation on first hover (localStorage flag to show once)
    - Drop zones: "Drop here to add to [Pawkit Name]" tooltip
  Command: `claude-code "Enhance visual affordances: 1) Strengthen selected card state (purple border glow), 2) Show drop zones when dragging (purple highlight on Pawkits), 3) Add pulse animation to hover+button on first hover (localStorage 'seen-hover-button'), 4) Show drop zone tooltips, 5) Ensure all animations match glass design system"`

- [ ] Empty state guidance (30 min) - [impl: ] [test: ] [done: ]
  Why: Empty states are teaching moments - guide users on next action
  Impact: New users know what to do when starting out
  Implementation:
    - When user has cards but no Pawkits: 'Create your first Pawkit to organize your bookmarks' (with arrow to + button)
    - When user has Pawkits but no cards in them: 'Right-click cards or drag them here' (shown in empty Pawkit view)
    - When user has no cards and no Pawkits: Show both messages contextually
    - Use glass cards with purple glow for empty state messages
  Command: `claude-code "Add empty state guidance: 1) No Pawkits but has cards: show 'Create your first Pawkit' message with arrow to + button, 2) Empty Pawkit: show 'Right-click cards or drag them here' message, 3) No cards or Pawkits: show contextual messages, 4) Use glass card design with purple glow, 5) Make dismissible per session"`

## KNOWN ISSUES (Shipping with workarounds)

**Issues that remain unresolved but have documented workarounds or are acceptable to ship with**

### Chromium Flickering Bug in Library View

**Status**: Shipping with bug (Firefox/Zen users unaffected)

**Problem Description**:
Cards flicker and disappear in Library view when:
- Left sidebar is floating (not taking layout space)
- Right sidebar is anchored (attached to content panel)
- BOTH "Show Thumbnails" and "Show Labels" are enabled
- Only affects Chromium browsers (Chrome, Dia, Edge)
- Works perfectly in Firefox and Zen Browser

**Root Cause**:
Fundamental Chromium rendering bug with CSS columns (masonry layout) during parent container transitions:
- ContentPanel resizes from 1342px → 1359px when right panel anchors
- Triggers 8+ resize events during 300ms transition
- Each resize recalculates CSS columns layout
- Backdrop-blur pills on cards trigger expensive repaint on each recalculation
- Chromium's CSS columns implementation can't handle parent transitions smoothly

**Trigger Conditions**:
1. Left panel: Floating mode
2. Right panel: Anchored mode (embedded inside content panel)
3. View settings: Show Thumbnails = ON
4. View settings: Show Labels = ON
5. Browser: Any Chromium-based (Chrome, Dia, Edge, Brave)

**All Attempted Fixes** (None successful):

1. ❌ **CSS Padding Hacks** (Commits: 6f78f08 → reverted)
   - Tried `pr-[341px]` and `pr-[325px]` to prevent card overlap
   - Result: Made visual unity worse, cards still disappeared
   - Reverted to original ContentPanel positioning

2. ❌ **ResizeObserver Optimization** (Commit: 379bcd9)
   - Fixed infinite loop (removed forced reflow)
   - Added debug logging to track resize events
   - Result: Reduced resize count but flickering remained

3. ❌ **ResizeObserver Debouncing** (Commit: 35a7f02)
   - Added 350ms debounce (matching transition duration)
   - Only processes final resize after ContentPanel settles
   - Result: Helped slightly but core issue persists

4. ❌ **ContentPanel Hardware Acceleration** (Commit: e46a48d)
   - Added `willChange: "left, right"` and `transform: translateZ(0)`
   - Forces GPU acceleration for panel transitions
   - Result: No improvement in card rendering

5. ❌ **Backdrop-blur Pills Optimization** (Commit: dd6e0d9)
   - Added hardware acceleration to URL pills and title pills
   - `willChange: 'width'` and `transform: translateZ(0)`
   - Result: Pills render better but cards still flicker

6. ❌ **Card Container GPU Acceleration** (Commit: 202b040)
   - Added hardware acceleration to individual card containers
   - Attempted to isolate card rendering from parent transitions
   - Result: No visible improvement

7. ❌ **Masonry Container Optimization** (Commit: 3541ab3)
   - Added `willChange: 'columns'` and `transform: translateZ(0)` to masonry grid
   - Attempted to hint GPU to optimize columns recalculation
   - Result: Flickering persists

8. ❌ **Disable ContentPanel Transitions** (Commit: 15449f5)
   - Disabled smooth transitions entirely in embedded mode: `transition: "none"`
   - Removed animation to eliminate intermediate resize states
   - Result: No improvement (issue is CSS columns, not transitions)

**Workarounds**:
- Use Firefox or Zen Browser (works perfectly)
- Disable "Show Thumbnails" OR "Show Labels" in settings
- Keep right panel in floating mode instead of anchored
- Keep left panel in anchored mode

**Potential Future Solutions**:
1. Switch from CSS columns to JavaScript masonry library (Masonry.js, react-masonry-css)
2. Wait for Chromium to fix CSS columns rendering bug
3. Detect Chromium and use different layout algorithm
4. Investigate reverting multi-select integration (known working state: commit 8eb379e)
5. Implement virtual scrolling to reduce cards rendered during transition

**Related Commits**:
- fae06ff - Reverted to original ContentPanel (removed padding hacks)
- 379bcd9 - Fixed ResizeObserver infinite loop
- 35a7f02 - Debounced ResizeObserver (350ms)
- e46a48d - Hardware acceleration on ContentPanel
- dd6e0d9 - Hardware acceleration on backdrop-blur pills
- 202b040 - GPU acceleration on card containers
- 3541ab3 - Hardware acceleration on masonry container
- 15449f5 - Disabled ContentPanel transitions in embedded mode

**User Impact**: Low (minority of users, Firefox/Zen unaffected, workarounds available)

**Priority**: P3 (post-launch optimization)

**See Also**: `.claude/skills/pawkit-troubleshooting/SKILL.md` Issue #9 for debugging process

## BACKLOG - CRITICAL (Pre-Merge)

**Must complete before merging to main**

### UI Polish Tasks (Phase 0)

- [ ] Remove Inbox from Home View (20 min) - [impl: ] [test: ] [done: ]
  Why: Dead feature, clutters UI, serves no purpose
  Impact: Cleaner home page, removes '0 unread items' section
  Command: `claude-code "Remove the 'Inbox' section from the Home view (app/(dashboard)/home/page.tsx). The Inbox section with '0 unread items' serves no purpose and should be removed. Clean up any related state, queries, or components that were specific to Inbox functionality."`

- [ ] Re-enable Settings Menu (45 min) - [impl: ] [test: ] [done: ]
  Why: Users need access to app settings
  Impact: Restore settings functionality disabled during UI overhaul
  Command: `claude-code "Re-enable the settings menu that was disabled during UI overhaul. Find the disabled settings component and restore its functionality. Ensure it opens properly and all settings are accessible."`

- [✓] Unify Tags Styling (25 min) - [implemented: ✓] [tested: ✓] [complete: ✓]
  Why: Consistency improves UX, reduces confusion
  Impact: Consistent tag display across Library and Pawkits views
  Fixed: Library tags now use glass pill buttons matching Pawkits view
  Commit: 58132cd - Updated Library tags to glass pill buttons with purple glow

- [ ] Fix Right Sidebar (45 min) - [impl: ] [test: ] [done: ]
  Why: Navigation consistency across all views
  Impact: Sidebar consistently appears in all main views
  Command: `claude-code "Fix the right sidebar not appearing/working in some views. Identify which views have broken sidebar functionality and restore it. The sidebar should consistently appear across all main views (Library, Pawkits, Notes, etc.)."`

### ~~Pawkit UX - Quick Wins~~ (SUPERSEDED - See Discoverability Improvements above)

**Status**: These tasks have been superseded by the Discoverability Improvements approach. User testing revealed features already exist and work well - the issue is discovery, not implementation. The interactive onboarding checklist addresses all of these needs more effectively.

**Superseded by**: Interactive onboarding checklist + Enhanced visual affordances + Empty state guidance

- [SUPERSEDED] ~~'Add to Pawkit' in context menu~~ - Feature already exists and works perfectly (card-context-menu.tsx line 137), users just don't discover it. Onboarding checklist Step 2 demonstrates this feature instead.

- [SUPERSEDED] ~~Onboarding tooltips for Pawkits~~ - Replaced by comprehensive interactive onboarding checklist which provides better guided experience across all features.

- [SUPERSEDED] ~~Visual drag-and-drop feedback~~ - Covered by "Enhanced visual affordances" task which includes drop zone highlighting and tooltips.

- [KEPT] Inline Pawkit rename (30 min) - Moved to Discoverability Improvements section with edit icon affordance added.

### ~~Pawkit UX - Enhanced Features~~ (MOVED - See Phase 3 Bulk Operations)

**Status**: These power-user features remain important but are not urgent for initial discoverability. Moved to Phase 3 where they integrate with broader bulk operations UI.

- [MOVED] Keyboard shortcut for Add to Pawkit - See Phase 3: Priority 1: Keyboard Shortcuts
- [MOVED] Multi-select bulk add to Pawkit - See Phase 3: Priority 2: Bulk Operations
- [MOVED] Quick-add from card detail view - See Phase 3: Priority 2: Bulk Operations

### Optional Pre-Launch

- [ ] Manual multi-session test (15 min) - [impl: N/A] [test: ] [done: ]
  Open 2 browser tabs, verify conflict detection works
  Why: Validate core multi-session detection functionality

- [ ] Final UI consistency pass (30 min) - [impl: N/A] [test: ] [done: ]
  Check all views for styling inconsistencies
  Why: Polish before launch

### Priority 5: UI Consistency (Post-Launch)

**Note**: These are gradual improvements, NOT blocking launch. Implement as time allows after deployment is stable.

- [ ] Update Dig Up modal (1 hour) - [impl: ] [test: ] [done: ]
  Why: User hates dog emoji, clunky layout
  Impact: Better visual consistency
  Command: `claude-code "Update Dig Up modal to match Selective Glow design system: 1) Remove 🐕 emoji, replace with Sparkles icon from lucide-react, 2) Convert to GlassModal pattern with glass top bar and bottom bar, 3) Use glass pill buttons instead of plain buttons, 4) Use rounded-3xl for content area. See .claude/skills/pawkit-ui-ux/SKILL.md for complete GlassModal pattern."`

See .claude/skills/pawkit-ui-ux/SKILL.md section on GlassPillButton."`

- [ ] Update navigation indicators (30 min) - [impl: ] [test: ] [done: ]
  Why: Thicker glow bar, not thin line
  Impact: Better active state visibility
  Command: `claude-code "Update navigation active indicators (Library/Calendar/Timeline tabs): 1) Change from h-0.5 to h-1 for thickness, 2) Add purple glow shadow-[0_0_10px_rgba(168,85,247,0.6)], 3) Use rounded-full for smooth appearance, 4) Ensure width matches text width dynamically. See .claude/skills/pawkit-ui-ux/SKILL.md section on NavItem pattern."`

- [ ] Update sliders to glass theme (1 hour) - [impl: ] [test: ] [done: ]
  Why: Match glass aesthetic
  Impact: Visual consistency
  Command: `claude-code "Update control panel sliders to glass theme: 1) Replace browser default styling with custom glass slider, 2) Use glass track (bg-white/5 border-white/10 backdrop-blur-md), 3) Purple fill with glow, 4) Custom thumb with glass effect and purple border. See .claude/skills/pawkit-ui-ux/SKILL.md section on GlassSlider for complete implementation."`
