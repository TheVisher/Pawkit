## Overview

Pawkit Web Clipper ("the Extension") is a browser extension that helps you save web pages, articles, and links to your Pawkit collections. This privacy policy explains how we handle your data.

The Extension collects and stores the following data locally on your device:

- **Bookmarks and Web Pages**: URLs, titles, and descriptions of pages you choose to save
- **Collections**: Organization folders and categories you create

### How We Store Your Data

- All data is stored **locally** in your browser using Chrome's storage API
- No data is transmitted to third-party servers except:
  - When you explicitly choose to sync with your Pawkit account (pawkit.vercel.app or getpawkit.com)
  - When fetching metadata for saved pages (only the URLs you choose to save)

- **activeTab**: To access the current page's URL and title when saving
- **contextMenus**: To add "Save to Pawkit" to your right-click menu

## Data Sharing

## Data Security

- All data remains on your device unless you explicitly sync with the Pawkit web application
- Communication with Pawkit servers (when syncing) uses HTTPS encryption

## Your Rights

You have the right to:
