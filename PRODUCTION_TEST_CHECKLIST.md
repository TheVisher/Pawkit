# Production Test Checklist - Layer 2 (Local-First Architecture)

## ‚úÖ What Changed
- **Data storage**: Now uses IndexedDB as primary source (was server)
- **Server role**: Changed from source-of-truth to sync/backup layer
- **Performance**: Should be noticeably faster (instant operations)
- **Safety**: Data survives server wipes, network issues, crashes

---

## üß™ Critical Tests (Must Pass)

### 1. Basic CRUD Operations
- [ ] **Add a new card**
  - Click "Add Card" or use extension
  - Verify card appears instantly in UI
  - Check browser console for `[DataStore V2] Card added to local storage: temp_...`
  - Wait 2-3 seconds and check console for `[DataStore V2] Card synced to server:`

- [ ] **Edit an existing card**
  - Click on a card and edit its title or notes
  - Verify changes appear instantly in UI
  - Check console for `[DataStore V2] Card updated in local storage:`
  - Check console for `[DataStore V2] Card synced to server:`

- [ ] **Delete a card**
  - Delete a card
  - Verify it disappears instantly from UI
  - Check console for `[DataStore V2] Card deleted from local storage:`
  - Check console for `[DataStore V2] Card deleted from server:`

- [ ] **Add a collection (Pawkit)**
  - Create a new collection
  - Verify it appears in sidebar
  - Check console for `[DataStore V2] Collection added to local storage:`

- [ ] **Move card between collections**
  - Drag a card to a different collection
  - Verify it appears in the new collection
  - Check console for update messages

### 2. Data Persistence
- [ ] **Refresh page**
  - Add a card
  - Press F5 or CMD+R
  - Verify card is still there after refresh
  - Check console for `[DataStore V2] Loaded from local: { cards: X, collections: Y }`

- [ ] **Close and reopen browser**
  - Add a card
  - Close browser completely
  - Reopen and navigate to app
  - Verify card is still there

- [ ] **Check IndexedDB storage**
  - Open DevTools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí IndexedDB
  - Find `pawkit-local-storage` database
  - Open `cards` store
  - Verify your cards are stored there
  - Check for `_locallyModified`, `_locallyCreated`, `_serverVersion` fields

### 3. Performance Check
- [ ] **App load time**
  - Note: Should feel faster than before
  - Cards should appear almost instantly (from IndexedDB)
  - No waiting for server response

- [ ] **Card operations**
  - Adding/editing/deleting should be instant
  - No spinner or loading delay
  - Background sync happens silently

### 4. Server Sync Verification
- [ ] **Check server has the data**
  - Add a card locally
  - Wait 3-5 seconds
  - Go to Supabase dashboard or use API
  - Verify card exists in database with correct data

- [ ] **Check sync status in console**
  - Look for these messages:
    - `[DataStore V2] Initializing from local storage...`
    - `[DataStore V2] Loaded from local: { cards: X, collections: Y }`
    - `[DataStore V2] Syncing with server in background...`
    - `[DataStore V2] Sync complete:`

## üî• Advanced Tests (Important)

### 5. Multi-Device Sync
- [ ] **Add card on Device A**
  - Add a card on your computer
  - Wait 10 seconds for sync

- [ ] **Check card appears on Device B**
  - Open app on phone or different browser
  - Refresh page
  - Verify card from Device A appears

- [ ] **Bidirectional sync**
  - Edit card on Device B
  - Wait 10 seconds
  - Refresh Device A
  - Verify changes appear on Device A

### 6. Offline Mode
- [ ] **Disable network**
  - Open DevTools ‚Üí Network tab
  - Check "Offline" checkbox

- [ ] **Add cards while offline**
  - Add 2-3 cards
  - Verify they appear in UI
  - Check IndexedDB - cards should be there

- [ ] **Re-enable network**
  - Uncheck "Offline"
  - Wait 10-20 seconds
  - Check console for sync messages
  - Verify cards sync to server

### 7. Conflict Resolution
- [ ] **Edit same card on two devices**
  - Open same card on Device A and Device B
  - Edit title on Device A, save
  - Edit notes on Device B, save
  - Wait for sync
  - Verify last-write-wins (most recent edit stays)

### 8. Export/Import
- [ ] **Export your data**
  - Go to Settings (or wherever export is)
  - Click "Export Data"
  - Verify JSON file downloads
  - Open file and check it has your cards/collections

- [ ] **Import data**
  - Click "Import Data"
  - Select the exported JSON file
  - Verify data appears in app
  - Check IndexedDB to confirm import

---

## üö® Edge Cases (Good to Test)

### 9. Large Dataset
- [ ] **Test with many cards**
  - If you have 100+ cards, verify:
    - App still loads quickly
    - Scrolling is smooth
    - Search works
    - No console errors

### 10. Error Scenarios
- [ ] **Server is down**
  - Simulate by blocking API calls in DevTools (Network ‚Üí Block request URL)
  - Try adding a card
  - Verify card still saves locally
  - Check console for error message but app still works

- [ ] **Invalid data**
  - Try importing a corrupted JSON file
  - Verify app shows error message
  - Verify app doesn't crash

---

## üìä Console Log Checklist

### Expected Console Messages:

**On page load:**
```
[DataStore V2] Initializing from local storage...
[DataStore V2] Loaded from local: { cards: X, collections: Y }
[DataStore V2] Syncing with server in background...
[LocalStorage] Saved card: abc123 { fromServer: true }
[DataStore V2] Sync complete: { success: true, pulled: {...}, pushed: {...} }
```

**On add card:**
```
[LocalStorage] Saved card: temp_1234567890_abc { localOnly: true }
[DataStore V2] Card added to local storage: temp_1234567890_abc
[DataStore V2] Card synced to server: real-uuid-from-server
```

**On update card:**
```
[LocalStorage] Saved card: uuid { localOnly: true }
[DataStore V2] Card updated in local storage: uuid
[DataStore V2] Card synced to server: uuid
```

**On delete card:**
```
[LocalStorage] Deleted card: uuid
[DataStore V2] Card deleted from local storage: uuid
[DataStore V2] Card deleted from server: uuid
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Watch Out For:
- `Failed to sync card to server` - Means network/server issue but data is safe locally
- `Conflict detected` - Means card was edited on another device
- `Sync failed` - Check network connection
- Any errors mentioning IndexedDB - Report immediately

---

- ‚úÖ Data persists across browser close/reopen
- ‚úÖ Data syncs to server within 10 seconds
- ‚úÖ App feels faster than before
- ‚úÖ No critical errors in console

### Nice to Have:
- ‚úÖ Multi-device sync works

## üêõ How to Report Issues

If you find a problem, please report:
1. **What you were doing** - Exact steps to reproduce
2. **What happened** - What you saw vs what you expected
3. **Console logs** - Copy/paste relevant console messages
4. **Browser/device** - Chrome/Safari, desktop/mobile
5. **Screenshot** - If applicable

Example:
```
Issue: Card doesn't sync to server
Steps: Added card ‚Üí waited 30 seconds ‚Üí checked database ‚Üí not there
Console: "[DataStore V2] Failed to sync card to server: Network error"
Browser: Chrome 118 on macOS
```

---

## üîÑ Rollback Plan (If Needed)

If critical issues occur:
1. Check git - we have backup: `lib/stores/data-store-v1-backup.ts`
2. Can revert by copying backup back to `data-store.ts`
3. User data is safe in IndexedDB - won't be lost during rollback

---

## üìù Notes

- **Performance**: Should be noticeably faster - operations are instant
- **Network**: App works offline now, syncs when back online
- **Data Safety**: Even if server is wiped, local data survives
- **Console Logs**: More verbose now - this is intentional for debugging
- **IndexedDB**: You can inspect it in DevTools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí IndexedDB

---

## ‚úÖ Quick Test (5 minutes)

Minimum viable test before deploying:
1. Add a card ‚Üí verify instant UI + console logs
2. Refresh page ‚Üí verify card persists
3. Check IndexedDB ‚Üí verify data is there
4. Wait 10s ‚Üí check database ‚Üí verify synced to server
5. Edit card ‚Üí verify instant UI + sync
6. Delete card ‚Üí verify instant UI + sync

If all 6 pass ‚Üí Good to go! ‚úÖ
