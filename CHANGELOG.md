### Fixed
- **Critical: Local-First Architecture Violations** - Fixed multiple components bypassing IndexedDB and writing directly to server
  - Den Pawkits: Create, rename, and delete operations now use data store for local-first updates
  - Timeline: Bulk move and delete operations now update IndexedDB before syncing to server
  - Dig Up: Delete and add-to-collection operations now follow local-first pattern
  - All operations now ensure fast, responsive updates while maintaining data integrity across devices
- **Critical: Sidebar Crash** - Fixed null reference error when collections missing children property after PostgreSQL migration
  - Added null safety checks in app-sidebar.tsx and resizable-sidebar.tsx
  - Prevents "can't access property 'length', s.children is undefined" error
- Fixed YouTube video embedding in card modals - videos now display and play correctly in the main modal content area
- Added CSP (Content Security Policy) support for YouTube iframes by adding `frame-src` directive for youtube.com domains
- Fixed sidebar layout issues where tabs were cramped when viewing YouTube cards
- YouTube cards now properly display in a 16:9 aspect ratio with responsive sizing

### Changed

### Technical
- **Data Store Enhancements**: Extended data-store.ts to support Den Pawkits with `inDen` parameter
  - `addCollection()` now routes to `/api/den/pawkits` when `inDen: true`
  - `updateCollection()` and `deleteCollection()` automatically detect Den collections and use correct API endpoint
  - All operations maintain local-first pattern: IndexedDB â†’ Server sync
