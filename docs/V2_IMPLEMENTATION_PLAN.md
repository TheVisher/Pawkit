## 1. Major Features

### 1.1 Daily Notes
**Priority:** HIGH | **Effort:** Medium | **V1 Adoption:** 47.8%

Daily notes are date-linked markdown notes for journaling and daily capture.

#### Requirements
- [ ] Daily note data model (card with `isDailyNote` flag or dedicated type)
- [ ] "Today's Note" widget on Home dashboard
- [ ] Create/open daily note from Calendar day view
- [ ] Prev/Next day navigation in daily note editor
- [ ] Daily note templates (optional)
- [ ] Quick access from Omnibar ("today", "yesterday", "tomorrow")

#### Data Model
```typescript
// Option A: Use existing Card with metadata flag
{
  type: 'md-note',
  scheduledDate: Date,  // The date this note represents
  metadata: { isDailyNote: true }
}

// Option B: New card type
{
  type: 'daily-note',
  scheduledDate: Date
}
```

#### UI Locations
- Home dashboard: "Today's Note" card/widget

---

---

## 5. Settings Page
**Priority:** HIGH | **Effort:** Medium

Currently no settings page exists. Users need a centralized place to configure preferences.

### 5.1 General Settings

### 5.2 Reader Mode Settings
- [ ] **Default view:** Modal, Full Viewport, or Browser Fullscreen
- [ ] **Default theme:** Dark, Sepia, or Light
- [ ] **Default font size:** 14-24px (persist across sessions)
- [ ] **Font family:** Sans-serif (default), Serif, or System
- [ ] **Line spacing:** Compact, Normal, Relaxed
- [ ] **Content width:** Narrow (600px), Medium (800px), Wide (1000px)

---

## 6. Reader Mode Enhancements

Features we have vs. what's standard in reader apps:

### Currently Implemented
- [x] Clean article extraction (@mozilla/readability)
- [x] Font size controls (14-24px)
- [x] Theme toggle (dark/sepia/light)
- [x] Reading progress tracking (scroll %)
- [x] Auto-mark as read at 95%
- [x] Three-tier view (modal → viewport → fullscreen)
- [x] Word count and reading time display
- [x] On-demand extraction (user clicks "Reader Mode" to extract)

### Extraction Mode Note
Currently using **on-demand extraction** - articles are only extracted when user clicks "Reader Mode" button. This was changed from auto-extract-on-save because:
- Auto-extraction caused 2+ minute hangs on some URLs
- Not all saved URLs need reader mode
- Reduces server load and API calls

**Future option:** Add user preference in Settings:
- [ ] **Extraction mode:** "On-demand" (current) vs "Auto on save"
- [ ] If auto: queue extraction in background, don't block save
- [ ] Show "Extracting..." indicator on card while processing

### Missing Basic Features
- [ ] **Font family toggle** - Serif vs Sans-serif (readers expect this)
- [ ] **Line spacing control** - Compact/Normal/Relaxed
- [ ] **Persist preferences** - Font size, theme, view mode saved to localStorage/settings
- [ ] **Keyboard shortcuts** - Arrow keys for font size, T for theme, Esc to close
- [ ] **Estimated time remaining** - "3 min left" based on scroll position

### Nice-to-Have Features
- [ ] **Text-to-speech** - "Listen" mode (Web Speech API)
- [ ] **Article outline/TOC** - Jump to headings (extract h2/h3 from content)
- [ ] **Distraction-free mode** - Hide header/controls until hover

### 6.1 Highlighting & Annotations System

Progressive implementation from simple to advanced:

#### Phase 1: Basic Highlights (Persist Across Sessions)
- [ ] Select text in reader → floating toolbar appears → click highlight icon
- [ ] Highlight applies with default color (yellow)
- [ ] **Highlights persist** - saved to card metadata, survive close/refresh/sync
- [ ] Highlights render when article reopens (restore from saved positions)
- [ ] Visual indicator in card grid showing article has highlights

#### Phase 2: Highlight Interactions
- [ ] **Click highlight** → popover shows annotation (if exists) or "Add note" prompt
- [ ] **Right-click highlight** → context menu:
  - Change color (yellow, green, blue, pink)
  - Add/edit annotation
  - Copy text
  - Export to article notes
  - Delete highlight
- [ ] Annotation popover has text field for quick thoughts
- [ ] Annotations saved inline with highlight

#### User Flow Example
```
1. User reads article, selects important paragraph
2. Floating toolbar appears → clicks highlight icon → text highlighted yellow
3. Later, user right-clicks highlight → "Add note"
4. Popover appears with text field: "This relates to our mobile nav problem"
5. User saves, continues reading
6. Next week, user reopens article
7. Highlights are visible, clicks one → sees their note from last time
8. "Oh right, I was thinking about mobile nav!"
```

#### Phase 3: Unified Card Notes (Builds on V1)

V1 Pawkit already has a notes section per card. Expand this to be the unified home for both manual notes AND auto-saved highlights.

**Concept:** Each card has one "notes" field (markdown). When user highlights text in reader, it auto-appends to the card's notes in a structured format. User can also add their own notes manually.

- [ ] Card notes section shows in card detail modal (already exists in V1)
- [ ] "Notes" tab/button in reader mode opens notes panel
- [ ] **Auto-save highlights:** When user creates highlight, auto-append to card notes
- [ ] Format: blockquote + annotation + separator
- [ ] User can edit/reorder notes freely (it's just markdown)
- [ ] Click highlight reference in notes → scrolls to position in article

**Auto-append format:**
```markdown
> "The best interface is no interface at all."

This aligns with our mobile-first philosophy.

---
```

**Full example of a card's notes after reading:**
```markdown
# My Notes

Initial thoughts before reading: Heard this was a good article on design principles.

---

> "The best interface is no interface at all."

This aligns with our mobile-first philosophy. Less chrome = more content.

---

> "Users don't read, they scan."

Need to review our dashboard density. Maybe we're showing too much.

---

## Summary

Key takeaways:
- Simplify the nav
- Reduce information density
- Test with real users
```

#### Phase 4: Notes Panel in Reader
- [ ] Split or slide-out panel showing card notes while reading
- [ ] Real-time: see highlights appear as you create them
- [ ] Edit notes inline without leaving reader
- [ ] Toggle panel visibility (keyboard shortcut: `N`)

#### Data Model
```typescript
interface Highlight {
  id: string;
  cardId: string;           // Which article
  text: string;             // The highlighted text
  color: 'yellow' | 'green' | 'blue' | 'pink';
  startOffset: number;      // Character position in articleContent
  endOffset: number;
  annotation?: string;      // User's annotation (also saved to notes)
  createdAt: Date;
}

// LocalCard already has 'notes' field from V1
interface LocalCard {
  // ... existing fields
  notes?: string;           // Markdown notes (V1 - already exists)
  highlights?: Highlight[]; // For rendering highlights in reader
}
```

**Why both `highlights[]` and `notes`?**
- `highlights[]` stores position data for re-rendering highlights in the article
- `notes` is the human-readable markdown that users can edit freely
- When highlight is created: save to `highlights[]` AND append to `notes`
- This way notes remain editable markdown, not locked to highlight structure

#### Technical Notes
- Use character offsets (not DOM positions) for stability across re-renders
- Re-apply highlights by wrapping text ranges with `<mark>` elements
- Handle edge cases: article content changes, overlapping highlights
- Sync both `highlights` and `notes` via existing card sync mechanism
- If user deletes text from notes, highlight still shows (they're independent)

### 6.2 Research Mode (Future - Post V2)

Full split-view research workflow for power users.

#### Concept
User is reading an article about UI design. They want to actively build their "UI Design Research" note while reading. Instead of switching back and forth, they work in a split view.

#### UI Flow
```

│                                 │  > is no interface"       │
│                                 │  > — Article Title        │
│                                 │                           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Features
- [ ] "Open Research Mode" button in reader toolbar
- [ ] Split view: Reader (left) + Note editor (right)
- [ ] Highlight in reader → drag to note position
- [ ] Auto-format as blockquote with source
- [ ] Note auto-saves as you edit
- [ ] Resizable split panes
- [ ] Mobile: swipe between reader and note (no split)

#### Entry Points
- Reader toolbar: "Research Mode" or "Take Notes" button
- Keyboard shortcut: `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + N`
- Right-click highlight: "Open in Research Mode"

#### Technical Considerations
- Split view layout component (resizable)
- Drag-and-drop from reader to editor
- Keep both views scrollable independently
- Handle unsaved changes on close
- Mobile fallback (tab switching vs split)

---

## 7. Multi-Media Content Extraction

Extend reader mode beyond articles to support multiple content types with the same highlight/notes workflow.

### 7.1 YouTube Transcripts
**Priority:** HIGH | **Effort:** Medium

Extract YouTube video transcripts so users can read, highlight, and take notes on video content.

#### Why This Matters
- Users save YouTube videos to watch later
- Transcripts let them skim/search content quickly
- Same highlight → notes workflow as articles
- Research across articles AND videos in one place

#### Features
- [ ] Detect YouTube URLs (youtube.com, youtu.be)
- [ ] Extract transcript via API or library
- [ ] Store in `articleContent` field (same as articles)
- [ ] Display in reader mode with timestamps
- [ ] Click timestamp → link to that point in video
- [ ] Highlight transcript text → same notes system
- [ ] Show video thumbnail and metadata (duration, channel)

#### Technical Options
```typescript
// Option 1: youtube-transcript npm package (no API key)
import { YoutubeTranscript } from 'youtube-transcript';
const transcript = await YoutubeTranscript.fetchTranscript(videoId);

// Option 2: YouTube Data API v3 (requires API key)
// More reliable but needs API setup

// Option 3: yt-dlp / ytdl-core for metadata + captions
```

#### Transcript Format in Reader
```
[0:00] Introduction to the concept
[0:45] First key point about design systems
[1:23] "The best designs are invisible" ← user can highlight this
[2:10] Example walkthrough
...
```

#### Data Model Addition
```typescript
interface LocalCard {
  // ... existing fields
  contentType?: 'article' | 'youtube' | 'podcast' | 'pdf' | 'github';
  transcript?: string;        // For video/audio content
  duration?: number;          // Video/audio length in seconds
  timestamps?: boolean;       // Whether transcript has timestamps
}
```

---

### 7.2 Future Content Types

Same pattern can extend to:

| Content Type | Extraction Method | Effort |
|--------------|-------------------|--------|
| **Podcasts** | Whisper API / podcast RSS transcripts | High |
| **PDFs** | pdf.js or pdf-parse | Medium |
| **Twitter threads** | Twitter API / scraping | Medium |
| **Reddit posts** | Reddit API | Low |
| **GitHub repos** | README.md via raw URL | Low |

#### Vision
User saves any URL → Pawkit extracts readable content → User highlights and takes notes → All notes aggregate into research documents.

"I'm researching UI design" → Save 10 articles, 5 YouTube videos, 3 podcast episodes → Highlight key points from all of them → Export combined notes → Research complete.

---

## 8. Future Ideas (Post-V2)

### 8.1 Continuous Reading Queue
**Priority:** Future | **Effort:** Medium-High

Allow users to stay in reader mode and continuously scroll through multiple articles without returning to the library.

#### Concept
Instead of reading one article → closing → opening next, users can scroll past the end of an article to seamlessly load the next one. Queue can be based on:
- **Tag-based:** All articles tagged "UI Design"
- **Pawkit-based:** All articles in a collection
- **Manual queue:** User-curated reading list
- **Smart queue:** Unread articles sorted by reading time

#### Prior Art
| App | Implementation |
|-----|----------------|
| Matter | Explicit queue system, continuous flow |
| Apple News | Infinite scroll through curated articles |
| Flipboard | Swipe-based continuous reading by topic |
| Kindle | Continuous scroll through book series |
| Feedly | Keyboard shortcuts for mark-read-and-advance |

#### Technical Considerations
- Preload next article at ~80% scroll progress
- Intersection observer for transition detection
- Visual divider between articles ("Next: [Title]" preview)
- Memory management (don't load all articles at once)
- Graceful handling of failed extractions mid-queue
- Back navigation (re-read previous article)
- Clear "end of queue" state
- Session metrics (articles read, time spent)

#### UI Flow
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Article 1 Title                    │
│  ...content...                      │
│  ...content...                      │
│  ─────────────────────────────────  │
│  END OF ARTICLE                     │
│  ↓ Keep scrolling for next          │
│  ┌─────────────────────────────────┐│
│  │ NEXT: Article 2 Title           ││
│  │ 8 min read • example.com        ││
│  └─────────────────────────────────┘│
│  ...Article 2 content...            │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Entry Points
- "Read All" button on tag page
- "Start Reading Session" on Pawkit/collection
- "Continue Queue" in reader toolbar
- Keyboard shortcut from reader (e.g., `Q` to queue remaining)
