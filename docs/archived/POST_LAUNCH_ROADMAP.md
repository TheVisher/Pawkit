---

## üöÄ Phase 0: Pre-Launch (Before Merge)

**Status:** In Progress
**Timeline:** 2-3 hours remaining
**Blocker:** Must complete before merge

### UI Polish Tasks

#### 1. Remove Inbox from Home View
```bash
claude-code "Remove the 'Inbox' section from the Home view (app/(dashboard)/home/page.tsx). The Inbox section with '0 unread items' serves no purpose and should be removed. Clean up any related state, queries, or components that were specific to Inbox functionality."
```

**Why:** Dead feature, clutters UI, serves no purpose
**Effort:** 15-20 minutes

#### 2. Re-enable Settings Menu
```bash
claude-code "Re-enable the settings menu that was disabled during UI overhaul. Find the disabled settings component and restore its functionality. Ensure it opens properly and all settings are accessible."
```

**Why:** Users need access to app settings
**Effort:** 30-60 minutes

#### 3. Unify Tags Styling
```bash
claude-code "Standardize the tags display across all views. Current inconsistency: Library view shows tags as '#tag-name' in vertical list, while Pawkits Overview shows them as pills with 'tag-name (count)'. Choose one style and apply it everywhere: components/control-panel/library-controls.tsx and the pawkits overview component."
```

**Current Issues:**
- Library: Vertical list with `#` prefix
- Pawkits Overview: Horizontal pills with counts

**Why:** Consistency improves UX, reduces confusion
**Effort:** 20-30 minutes

#### 4. Fix Right Sidebar
```bash
claude-code "Fix the right sidebar not appearing/working in some views. Identify which views have broken sidebar functionality and restore it. The sidebar should consistently appear across all main views (Library, Pawkits, Notes, etc.)."
```

**Why:** Navigation consistency
**Effort:** 30-60 minutes

### Optional Pre-Launch
- [ ] Manual multi-session test (15 min) - Recommended
- [ ] Final UI consistency pass (30 min)

- No pagination on card lists
- Full table scans for searches

**Optimizations:**

#### 1.1 Add Indexes
```bash
claude-code "Optimize IndexedDB schema in lib/services/local-storage.ts: 1) Add composite index on (userId, updatedAt) for faster sync queries, 2) Add index on (userId, type) for filtering, 3) Add full-text search index on title and content fields, 4) Test query performance with 1000+ cards"
```

**Expected Impact:** 50-70% faster queries on large datasets
**Effort:** 2-3 hours
**Risk:** Medium (requires migration)

#### 1.2 Query Optimization
```bash
claude-code "Review all IndexedDB queries in lib/services/local-storage.ts and lib/stores/data-store.ts: 1) Use indexes for all queries, 2) Limit result sets with pagination, 3) Add query result caching for frequently accessed data, 4) Profile slow queries and optimize"
```

**Expected Impact:** Faster app load, smoother scrolling
**Effort:** 3-4 hours
**Risk:** Low

### Priority 2: Rendering Performance

```bash
claude-code "Add debouncing to search input: 1) Debounce search queries by 300ms, 2) Show loading state during search, 3) Cancel previous searches, 4) Add search result count, 5) Optimize search operators"
```

**Expected Impact:** Fewer unnecessary searches
**Effort:** 1-2 hours
**Risk:** Low

### Priority 4: Link Extraction Optimization

**Current Issues:**
- `extractAndSaveLinks` called excessively
- Logs spam console
- Performance impact during editing

**Fix:**
```bash
claude-code "Add debouncing to extractAndSaveLinks function in lib/stores/data-store.ts: 1) Use 500ms debounce on content changes, 2) Reduce logging verbosity, 3) Only extract when content actually changes, 4) Cancel pending extractions on unmount"
```

**Expected Impact:** Less console spam, better performance
**Effort:** 30-60 minutes
**Risk:** Low

### Success Metrics for Phase 2
