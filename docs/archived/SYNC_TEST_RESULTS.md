## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Test Environment Limitations

1. **Network-Dependent Tests:**
   - Tests 3.2 and 3.4 require network failures to fully validate
   - Pass rate: 0-100% depending on server state
   - **Mitigation:** Use MockFetch to simulate failures

2. **Browser Compatibility:**
   - BroadcastChannel not supported in Safari < 15.4, IE11
   - Tests gracefully skip on unsupported browsers
   - **Mitigation:** Test in modern browsers

3. **Timing Sensitivity:**
   - Some tests rely on timing (delays, timeouts)
   - May be flaky on slow machines or under CPU throttling
   - **Mitigation:** Increase timeout values if needed

### Implementation Limitations

1. **No Automated CI/CD:**
   - Tests require manual browser execution
   - Not integrated into GitHub Actions
   - **Future:** Convert to Playwright E2E tests

2. **No Unit Test Framework:**
   - Tests run in browser, not Jest/Vitest
   - Requires real IndexedDB and BroadcastChannel
   - **Future:** Add Jest with mocked browser APIs

3. **Limited Mocking:**
   - Network requests hit real API in some tests
   - May affect server data in edge cases
   - **Future:** Comprehensive MockFetch usage

## 🔧 Debugging Guide

### Common Issues

#### Issue: "BroadcastChannel is not defined"
**Cause:** Browser doesn't support BroadcastChannel
**Solution:** Use Chrome, Firefox, or Safari 15.4+

#### Issue: "Timeout waiting for condition"
**Cause:** Test assertion never became true
**Solution:** Check network connectivity, increase timeout

#### Issue: "Failed to fetch cards: HTTP 401"
**Cause:** User not authenticated
**Solution:** Log in before running tests

#### Issue: Tests hang indefinitely
**Cause:** Promise never resolves/rejects
**Solution:** Check for uncaught errors, clear browser storage

   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open test page:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3002/test/sync
   ```

3. **Click "Run All Tests"**

4. **Review results:**
   - Green = Pass
   - Red = Fail
   - Console output shows details

### Advanced Usage

**Run specific test suite:**

import { TestRunner } from '@/lib/services/__tests__/sync-service-test-utils';

const runner = new TestRunner();
await testMultiTabCoordination(runner);
runner.printSummary();
```

**Run with custom timeout:**
```javascript
// Increase timeout for slow networks
runner.waitFor(condition, { timeout: 10000 }); // 10 seconds
```

**Run with mock fetch:**
```javascript
import { MockFetch } from '@/lib/services/__tests__/sync-service-test-utils';

const mockFetch = new MockFetch();
mockFetch.mockResponse('/api/cards', { items: [] });
window.fetch = mockFetch.getFetch();
```
