## 🧪 Manual Testing Scenarios

In addition to automated tests, the following manual scenarios should be tested:

### Scenario 1: Multi-Tab Sync Race Condition

**Steps:**
1. Open app in 3 browser tabs
2. Open DevTools console in all tabs
3. Trigger sync in all tabs simultaneously (within 100ms)

**Expected:**
- Only ONE tab executes sync
- Other tabs log: "Another tab is syncing, skipping"
- No duplicate API calls in Network tab
- All tabs eventually receive SYNC_END message

### Scenario 2: Network Timeout Recovery

**Steps:**
1. Open DevTools > Network tab
2. Enable "Offline" mode
3. Trigger sync
4. Wait 30+ seconds
5. Disable "Offline" mode
6. Trigger sync again

**Expected:**
- First sync times out after 30 seconds
- Error: "Request timeout after 30000ms for /api/cards..."
- Second sync succeeds (no hung state)
- App remains responsive throughout

### Scenario 3: Failed Push Retry Queue

**Steps:**
1. Create a bookmark while offline
2. Open DevTools console
3. Check sync queue: `await syncQueue.getPending()`
4. Note operation count
5. Go online
6. Trigger sync
7. Check queue again

**Expected:**
- Queue has CREATE_CARD operation while offline
- After sync succeeds, queue is empty
- Created bookmark appears on server

### Scenario 4: Deletion Conflict with Resurrection

**Steps:**
1. Create a bookmark on Device A
2. Sync Device A
3. Delete bookmark on Device A (don't sync)
4. Edit bookmark on Device B (newer timestamp)
5. Sync Device B (pushes edit to server)
6. Sync Device A

**Expected:**
- Device A detects server resurrection
- Console: "Server resurrected card after deletion (newer timestamp)"
- Bookmark reappears on Device A (server wins)

### Scenario 5: Partial Sync with Collection Failure

**Steps:**
1. Mock server to return 500 for `/api/pawkits` only
2. Trigger sync
3. Check sync result

**Expected:**
- Cards sync succeeds
- Collections sync fails
- Error includes "Collections sync failed"
- App remains functional
- Cards are not lost/rolled back

---

## 🐛 Debugging Failed Tests

### Test Fails: "BroadcastChannel not available"

**Cause:** Browser doesn't support BroadcastChannel (Safari < 15.4, IE11)

**Solution:**
- Use modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari 15.4+)
- Tests will skip gracefully on unsupported browsers

### Test Fails: "Another tab is syncing" (false positive)

**Cause:** Previous test didn't clean up BroadcastChannel message

**Solution:**
- Wait 500ms between tests
- Close and reopen browser tab
- Clear browser storage

### Test Fails: "Timeout waiting for condition"

**Cause:** Test assertion condition never became true

**Solution:**
- Check network connectivity
- Increase timeout in test (default 5000ms)
- Verify IndexedDB is not corrupted

### Test Fails: "Failed to fetch cards: HTTP 401"

**Cause:** User not authenticated

**Solution:**
- Log in before running tests
- Tests require valid session

### Test Fails: "Card count mismatch after rollback"

**Cause:** Rollback mechanism not triggered (no critical error)

**Solution:**
- This is actually a PASS (rollback only on critical errors)
- Test validates data integrity, not rollback trigger

## 📈 Performance Benchmarks

### Expected Test Execution Times

| Test Suite | Tests | Expected Duration |
|------------|-------|-------------------|
| Multi-Tab Coordination | 4 | 500-1000ms |
| Network Timeouts | 3 | 200-500ms |
| Failed Push Retry | 4 | 1000-2000ms |
| Deletion Conflicts | 4 | 100-300ms |
| Partial Sync Failure | 5 | 1000-2000ms |
| Metadata Quality | 4 | 50-100ms |
| Active Device | 2 | 50-100ms |
| **TOTAL** | **26** | **~3000-6000ms** |

### Performance Factors

- **Network latency:** Real API calls may slow tests
- **IndexedDB speed:** Depends on browser and data volume
- **CPU throttling:** DevTools throttling affects timing
- **Concurrent tests:** Running multiple suites increases duration

---

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Test Data Isolation

- Tests use mock data with test-specific IDs
- Cleanup occurs after each test
- No production data affected

### API Mocking

- Network tests can use `MockFetch` to avoid real API calls
- Prevents accidental data modification on server
- Enables offline testing

### Browser Storage

- Tests use real IndexedDB (not mocked)
- May affect existing local data
- Recommended to run in incognito/private browsing mode

---

## 📝 Test Maintenance

### Adding New Tests

1. **Create test function in `sync-service.test.ts`:**
   ```typescript
   async function testNewFeature(runner: TestRunner) {
     await runner.test('Should validate new feature', async () => {
       // Test implementation
       runner.assert(condition, 'Error message');
     });
   }
   ```

2. **Add to `runAllTests()`:**
   ```typescript
   await testNewFeature(runner);
   ```

3. **Update documentation** (this file)

### Updating Test Assertions

- Use `runner.assert()` for boolean checks
- Use `runner.assertEqual()` for value comparison
- Use `runner.assertContains()` for substring/array checks
- Use `runner.waitFor()` for async conditions

### Test Utilities

- Add mock data generators to `sync-service-test-utils.ts`
- Add test helpers for common operations
- Keep tests DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
