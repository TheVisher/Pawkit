# 🎉 YOLO Branch - Complete Implementation Summary

**Good morning!** While you were sleeping, I implemented the **entire high-priority roadmap** for Pawkit. Everything is ready for testing!

---

## ✅ What Was Implemented (7 Major Features)

### 1. **Global Keyboard Shortcuts System** ⌨️
- **15+ keyboard shortcuts** for navigation and actions
- Press `?` anywhere to see the help modal
- Quick actions: `Cmd+N` (new note), `Cmd+P` (new card), `Cmd+T` (today's note)
- Navigation: `G` then `H/L/C/N/P/D/T` (Home/Library/Calendar/Notes/Pawkits/Den/Tags)
- `/` to focus search, `Esc` to close modals
- Context-aware (doesn't trigger in input fields)

### 2. **Advanced Search with Operators** 🔍
Transform basic search into powerful filtering:
- `tag:work` - Filter by tags
- `type:note` or `type:url` - Filter by content type
- `date:today` / `date:yesterday` / `date:week` / `date:month` - Date filtering
- `in:collection-name` - Filter by pawkit
- `is:favorite` / `is:den` - Status filtering
- **Multiple operators combine** (e.g., `tag:work type:note date:week`)

### 3. **Dig Up Improvements** 🎯
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: `K` (keep), `D` (delete), `P` (move to pawkit), `S` (snooze)
- **Snooze functionality**: Tomorrow, 3 days, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months
- **"Never Show Again"** option to permanently hide cards
- **Progress indicator**: Shows "X of Y reviewed today"
- Visual keyboard hints on all action buttons

### 4. **Tag Management Page** 🏷️
New page at `/tags` for comprehensive tag management:
- View all tags with **usage counts**
- **Search and filter** tags
- **Rename tags** across all cards atomically
- **Delete tags** from all cards
- **View cards** with specific tag (one click)
- Toast notifications for all operations

### 5. **Recently Viewed Tracking** 📚
- Automatically tracks last 5 viewed cards/notes
- Shows in **sidebar** for quick access
- Smart navigation (notes scroll to ID, cards filter library)
- Persists in localStorage across sessions
- Works for both cards and notes

### 6. **Knowledge Graph Enhancements** 🕸️
- **Search/filter nodes** by name (live filtering)
- **Hover to highlight** connected nodes
- Click to select/deselect nodes
- Enhanced visual feedback (connected nodes grow, others dim)
- Better zoom controls with percentage display

### 7. **Toast Notification System** 🔔
- 4 types: Success, Error, Info, Warning
- Color-coded with icons
- Auto-dismiss after 3 seconds
- Stack multiple toasts
- Helper hook: `useToast()` with methods
