# Sync and Realtime Notes

Status: Legacy

This document described the old Supabase realtime setup. Pawkit now uses Convex for sync and realtime updates, so no manual SQL grants or Supabase configuration is required.

If you are working on an older branch, refer to git history for the previous Supabase instructions.
