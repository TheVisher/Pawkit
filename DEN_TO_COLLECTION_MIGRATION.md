# Den to Collection Migration

**Date:** 2025-10-28
**Migration:** `20251028000000_migrate_den_to_collection`

---

## üìã Overview

This migration converts the legacy "Den" feature from using a boolean flag (`inDen`) to using the new private collections system. It creates a special private collection called "The Den" and migrates all cards marked with `inDen=true` into this collection.

### What Changes

**Before Migration:**
- Cards have `inDen` boolean flag
- Den cards are filtered by `WHERE inDen = true`
- No dedicated "Den" collection exists

**After Migration:**
- Cards have `inDen = false` (flag deprecated)
- Den cards are in a private collection with slug `'the-den'`
- Cards filtered by `WHERE collections LIKE '%the-den%'` or using JSON operators

---

## üéØ What This Migration Does

### Step 1: Create "The Den" Collection

For each user who has cards with `inDen=true`, create a private collection:

```sql
Collection:
  id: "den_" + userId
  name: "The Den"
  slug: "the-den"
  isPrivate: true
```

**Idempotency:** Only creates if the user doesn't already have a collection with slug `'the-den'`.

### Step 2: Update Cards

For all cards where `inDen=true` and `deleted=false`:

| Current `collections` | Updated `collections` |
|-----------------------|----------------------|
| `null` | `["the-den"]` |
| `""` (empty string) | `["the-den"]` |
| `[]` (empty array) | `["the-den"]` |
| `["personal"]` | `["personal", "the-den"]` |
| `["work", "the-den"]` | `["work", "the-den"]` (no change) |

**Idempotency:** If a card already has `'the-den'` in collections, it's not added again.

### Step 3: Clear inDen Flag

Set `inDen = false` on all cards that were updated.

**Idempotency:** Safe to run multiple times.

## üß™ Testing the Migration

Before running the migration, use the test script to verify it's safe:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/test-den-migration.ts
```

### Test Script Output

The script shows:
- ‚úÖ How many users have Den cards
- ‚úÖ Sample cards that will be updated
- ‚úÖ Whether "the-den" collection already exists
- ‚úÖ JSON validation for all affected cards
- ‚úÖ Safety status (safe/needs attention)

**Example Output:**
```
üîç Testing Den to Collection Migration

üìä Step 1: Finding users with Den cards...
Found 1 user(s) with Den cards:
  - user@example.com: 11 Den card(s)

üì¶ Step 2: Checking for existing "the-den" collections...
  ‚ûï User user@example.com needs "the-den" collection created

üìù Step 3: Sample cards that will be updated...
  Card 1:
    Current collections: ["personal"]
    ‚û°Ô∏è  Will become: ["personal","the-den"]

üîí Step 5: Safety checks...
  ‚úÖ All cards have valid JSON in collections field
  ‚úÖ No slug conflicts detected

üìã Migration Summary:
  Users affected: 1
  Cards to update: 11
  Safety status: ‚úÖ SAFE TO RUN
```

## üöÄ Running the Migration

### Option 1: Using Prisma (Recommended)

```bash
npm run prisma:migrate:deploy
```

This will apply all pending migrations, including this one.

### Option 2: Manual SQL

If you need to run the migration manually:

```bash
psql $DATABASE_URL -f prisma/migrations/20251028000000_migrate_den_to_collection/migration.sql
```

### Option 3: Staging/Production

For production deployments:

1. **Test on staging first:**
   ```bash
   DATABASE_URL="your-staging-db" npx tsx scripts/test-den-migration.ts
   DATABASE_URL="your-staging-db" npm run prisma:migrate:deploy
   ```

2. **Verify staging results:**
   - Check that "The Den" collection appears in UI
   - Verify Den cards are in the collection
   - Confirm `inDen=false` on all cards

3. **Deploy to production:**
   ```bash
   npm run prisma:migrate:deploy
   ```

---

## üîí Safety Guarantees

### Idempotency

This migration is **100% idempotent** - safe to run multiple times:

1. **Collection Creation:** Uses `NOT EXISTS` check
   - If "the-den" collection exists, skip creation
   - No duplicate collections will be created

2. **Card Updates:** Uses `collections::jsonb ? 'the-den'` check
   - If card already has 'the-den', no update
   - No duplicate entries in collections array

3. **Flag Clearing:** Simple boolean update
   - Setting `false` multiple times is safe
   - No side effects

### Data Safety

- ‚úÖ **No data deletion** - Only adds to collections array
- ‚úÖ **Preserves existing collections** - Appends, doesn't replace
- ‚úÖ **Handles NULL/empty gracefully** - Safe for all cases
- ‚úÖ **JSON validation** - Test script checks before running
- ‚úÖ **Transaction safety** - All statements atomic

### Rollback Plan

If you need to rollback (not recommended):

```sql
-- WARNING: This removes "the-den" from all cards
-- Only run if absolutely necessary

-- Remove "the-den" from collections arrays
UPDATE "Card"
SET collections = (
  SELECT jsonb_agg(elem)::text
  FROM jsonb_array_elements(collections::jsonb) AS elem
  WHERE elem::text != '"the-den"'
)
WHERE collections::jsonb ? 'the-den';

-- Delete "The Den" collections
DELETE FROM "Collection"
WHERE slug = 'the-den';

-- Note: Original inDen flags cannot be restored
-- You would need a backup to restore them
```

## üìä Expected Impact

Based on test results:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Users affected | 1 |
| Cards updated | 11 |
| Collections created | 1 |
| Execution time | < 1 second |
| Database locks | Minimal (UPDATE locks only) |

### Performance

- **Small datasets (<1000 cards):** Instant (~100ms)
- **Medium datasets (1000-10000 cards):** < 1 second
- **Large datasets (>10000 cards):** 1-5 seconds

The migration uses efficient JSONB operations and indexes.

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Migration fails with "invalid JSON"

**Cause:** Some cards have malformed JSON in `collections` field

**Solution:**
1. Run test script to identify problematic cards
2. Fix manually or let migration reset to `["the-den"]`

**Prevention:** Migration handles invalid JSON by resetting to `["the-den"]`

### Issue: "Unique constraint violation on slug"

**Cause:** A user already has a collection with slug='the-den'

**Solution:** This is fine! Migration is idempotent and will skip creation.

**Verification:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM "Collection" WHERE slug = 'the-den';
```

### Issue: Cards still show inDen=true after migration

**Cause:** Migration didn't run or was interrupted

**Solution:**
1. Check migration status: `npx prisma migrate status`
2. Re-run migration: `npm run prisma:migrate:deploy`
3. Verify: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "Card" WHERE "inDen" = true;` should be 0

---

## ‚úÖ Verification

After running the migration, verify it worked:

### 1. Check Collections Created

```sql
SELECT id, name, slug, "isPrivate", "userId"
FROM "Collection"
WHERE slug = 'the-den';
```

**Expected:** One row per user who had Den cards

### 2. Check Cards Updated

```sql
SELECT id, title, collections, "inDen"
FROM "Card"
WHERE collections::jsonb ? 'the-den'
LIMIT 10;
```

**Expected:** All formerly-Den cards have 'the-den' in collections

### 3. Check inDen Flag

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as cards_with_inden_true
FROM "Card"
WHERE "inDen" = true AND deleted = false;
```

**Expected:** `0` (all should be false now)

### 4. UI Verification

1. Navigate to `/pawkits/the-den`
2. Verify all Den cards appear
3. Check that collection is marked as private
4. Verify cards don't appear in Library (unless also in other collections)

---

## üìù Post-Migration Tasks

### Optional: Remove inDen Field (Future)

After confirming the migration worked, you can remove the deprecated field:

1. **Update code:** Remove all references to `inDen` in codebase
2. **Create migration:** Remove column from schema
3. **Deploy:** Run migration to drop column

**Do NOT do this immediately** - wait at least 1 week to ensure no issues.

### Optional: Remove inDen Index

The `@@index([userId, inDen])` on Card can be removed:

```sql
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS "Card_userId_inDen_idx";
```

## üìö References

### Code Changes Required

After this migration, update code that references `inDen`:

**Before:**
```typescript
// Old way: using inDen boolean
const denCards = await prisma.card.findMany({
  where: {
    userId: user.id,
    inDen: true,
    deleted: false,
  },
});
```

**After:**
```typescript
// New way: using collections
const denCards = await prisma.card.findMany({
  where: {
    userId: user.id,
    collections: {
      contains: 'the-den',
    },
    deleted: false,
  },
});

// Or with JSON operators for exact match:
const denCards = await prisma.$queryRaw`
  SELECT * FROM "Card"
  WHERE "userId" = ${user.id}
    AND collections::jsonb ? 'the-den'
    AND deleted = false
`;
```

### API Changes

Update API endpoints that filter by `inDen`:

**Endpoints to update:**
- `GET /api/cards` - Add collection filter
- `GET /api/den` - Use collection-based filtering
- Any other endpoints using `inDen` field
